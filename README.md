# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!

### Pick you weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory - <code>cd directory name</code> - and run the game.py file in a python 3 Terimal window for mac/ Linux.
